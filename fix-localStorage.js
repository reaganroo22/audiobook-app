    {
      "question": "What is the 'Social Anxiety MicroProtocol' and what three actions does it include?",
      "answer": "A quick protocol to manage anxiety: box-breathe for three cycles (4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold), pick one easy social action (ask a name, give a compliment, or make an intro), and if overwhelmed, reset with a short walk, water, or shoulder roll before returning."
