## Usage

### For Users
1. **Landing Page**: Click footer links to access legal pages
2. **Authenticated App**: Click footer links to open legal pages in new tabs
3. **Support**: Use the contact form or browse FAQ for help
4. **Navigation**: Use back button to return to previous page

### For Developers
1. **Adding New Legal Pages**: Follow the pattern of existing components
2. **Updating Content**: Edit the respective component files
3. **Styling**: Use the established CSS patterns for consistency
4. **Routing**: Add new routes to the AppRouter component

## Contact Information

The legal pages include placeholder contact information that should be updated:
- Email: privacy@readingsucks.com (Privacy Policy)
- Email: legal@readingsucks.com (Terms of Service)  
- Email: support@readingsucks.com (Support)
- Address: [Your Business Address]

## Future Enhancements

1. **Form Backend**: Connect support form to actual email service
2. **Live Chat**: Implement real-time chat functionality
3. **Search**: Add search functionality to FAQ section
4. **Analytics**: Track page views and form submissions
5. **Multi-language**: Add support for multiple languages
6. **Version History**: Track changes to legal documents

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data is collected through the support form
- All form submissions are client-side only (needs backend integration)
- Legal pages are static and don't expose any user data
- Contact information should be validated before implementation
